# **Requirements**

Windows 10 or 11

Python 3.13.3 with PATH enabled

google-api-python-client

You do not need a fast internet connection to use this, no matter the amount of URLs you have

# **How to Install/Use**

## **Step 1. Download google-api-python-client**

Open command line by typing cmd in the search bar, copy paste "pip install google-api-python-client" and run

## **Step 2. Create an API key**

Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector2

Select "Create Project", or use an existing project

Name it anything you want and click "Create" (skip this if you have an existing project)

Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials and click "Create credentials", then click "API key"

Open the program and copy the API key and paste it into the "YouTube API key" part of the program

Also, do *NOT* give your API keys to ANYONE.

## **Step 3. Input and output files**

Create a .txt file anywhere you want and insert the YouTube URLs in it like this (put each link under eachother and have nothing else in the file):


https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvFZjo5PgG0


Select the .txt file you created by clicking "Browse" in the program

Click the "Save as" button on the program

Select where you want to save the file

Name it anything you want and put ".txt" at the end of it

Start scraping! The comments will be saved in the output file without anything added.

# **Notes**
I will probably not update this program or fix bugs (However, I might add Linux support soon). This program was NOT written by me, and it is completely AI made. Feel free to use it and modify it however you want.

This program does NOT store any API keys or other info. It is open-source, so you can check if it is a virus or not
